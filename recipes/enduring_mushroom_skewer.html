        <h2> Description </h2>
        <p> A good thief needs good stamina. After darting away from the scene of a crime until exhaustion, hastily eat this entire skewer and you'll be ready to double that distance! </p>
        <h2> Ingredients </h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Endura Shroom</li>
            <li>That's it!</li>
        </ul>
        <h2> Steps </h2>
        <ol>
            <li> Find an endura shroom or substitution </li>
            <li> Throw it in a cauldron and stir for 5 seconds</li>
            <li> Voila! It should automatically skew itself and now you can run twice as long! Repeat for infinite endurance. </li>
        </ol>
